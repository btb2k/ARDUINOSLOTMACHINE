ARDUINO SLOT MACHINE PROJECT

There are some bugs I'm working through on the reel spins but it's fairly close, the game play does work with the keypad and I'll be adding the buttons and fixing the 2nd reel in another update. 

Any code updates will take a few seconds to upload to yours so if you use it note that I plan to maintain wiring and add the additional modules (RFID tag for player balances, sound and LED control). The first version I compiled with all of it didn't quite work so decided it would be best to break it down and get a simple version working 100% and then add on to the base with new features which may require another Arduino (one to handle the stepper motors separately and then one to handle the game logic).  You are certainly welcome to modify the code and do it yourself, just noting that the libraries I used are GPL licensed of course and credit goes to those libraries for making this work.
